## Introduction
The primary goal of this project was to show off my react skills after learning it just 5 weeks ago. I created a horoscope reading application where users can select their zodiac sign, view their horoscope reading for today, tomorrow, and yesterday. From there users can also save a reading where it will be stored in local storage and displayed on the saved reading page. Users can then deleted saved readings from the saved reading page. The specifications for this project can be found [here](https://frontend.turing.edu/projects/module-3/showcase.html).


## Goals
* Create MVP and beyond.
* Use aztro API to get readings for today, tomorrow, and yesterday
* Use TDD - Cypress 
* Use local storage to store saved horoscope readings
* Easy to navigate UI/UX
